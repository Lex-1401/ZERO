## AI / Vibe Coded PRs are Welcome! ∅

Built it with Codex, Claude, or other AI tools? **Awesome — just flag it!**

Please include in your PR:

- [ ] Mark as AI-assisted in the PR title or description.
- [ ] Note the degree of testing (untested / lightly tested / fully tested).
- [ ] Include prompts or session logs if possible (super helpful!).
- [ ] Confirm you understand what the code does.

AI PRs are first-class citizens here. We just want transparency so reviewers know what to look for.
