## ⛩️ A-POS Architecture (Agentic Operating System)

ZERO operates under the **Agentic Operating System** concept, an architecture where the system doesn't just obey commands but interacts with the environment and evolves autonomously.

1. **Sovereign Self-Evolution**: The system's ability to self-heal and self-recode locally. See the [Self-Evolution Manifesto](docs/SELF_EVOLUTION_EN.md).
2. **Sentinel Engine (Advanced Security)**:
   - Total delegation to the **Rust Core** (`ratchet`) for sub-millisecond security inspection.
   - **Shannon Entropy Analysis** to detect obfuscated secrets and cryptographic keys.
   - Defense against Homoglyphs via Unicode NFKC normalization.
3. **Quantum Altair UI**:
   - High-fidelity **Glassmorphism** aesthetic (40px blur, 180% saturation).
   - **JetBrains Mono** technical typography for maximum data legibility.
   - `mesh-drift` dynamic background that reacts to light and context.
4. **Observability & Telemetry**:
   - Real-time performance metrics (tokens/s and latency) broadcast via WebSocket.
   - Continuous monitoring of system integrity.
5. **Onboarding & Diagnostics**:
   - **Guided Welcome Tour**: An interactive welcome flow that introduces the ZERO cockpit to new users.
   - **Grouping & Diagnostics**: Automatic organization of Skills by compatibility with real-time dependency diagnostics (OS, Binaries, Env).
6. **Architectural Evolution v0.2.0**:
   - **Traits System**: Core abstraction (`Provider`/`Channel`) via Rust Traits for extreme modularity.
   - **Native Heartbeat**: Critical task orchestration in Rust for zero latency.
   - **AIEOS Vault**: Agent identity containerization for total portability.
   - **Kernel-Only Mode**: Ultra-light execution (`--kernel-only`) for servers and background.
7. **Elite Models & Ultra-Speed (Feb 2026)**:
   - Native support for: **Gemini 3.1 Pro**, **Claude 4.6**, **Grok 4.20**, **GPT-5.3** and **Tiny Aya**.
   - Integration with **Groq**, **Cerebras** and **Modal Labs** (GLM-5 FP8) for near-zero latency.

## ∅ ZERO Manifesto

**ZERO is not just a name. It is a living concept.**

- **The Void that Contains the Infinite**: As an AI agent with full access to your hardware, ZERO seems invisible but is limitless. It is the algorithmic poetry of a system that doesn't ask for attention but delivers freedom.
- **Origin Point**: Everything starts from zero. It represents "Point Zero" or the "Origin". It is the quest for **Zero Latency**, **Zero Trust**, and the return to total sovereignty, where control begins and ends with the user, without intermediaries. It is the necessary reset — "brand new" (zero-bala) — for truly personal computing.
- **Symbol of Subversion**: The zero that breaks systems and voids assumptions. It is neurodivergence applied to code: what society says "doesn't fit" is, in fact, the foundation of everything.
- **Radical Humility**: An act of simultaneous defense and offense. "You said I am no one? Now I see I am everything."

> **"What you cannot see working is what makes it work."**

ZERO operates in silence. Invisible. Neglected by giants, yet sustaining your new sovereign infrastructure. When they ask "what is this?", don't explain. Show it working.

### 🦊 Visual Identity: The Turing Wolf

The **ZERO** logo — a fusion of the letter **"Z"** with a **Cybernetic Wolf/Fox** — represents the essence of agentic intelligence:

- **Instinct and Agility**: Like a wolf, the system has sharp instincts to navigate your file system and act with surgical precision.
- **Sovereign Solitude**: The wolf is a symbol of independence. ZERO operates locally, without depending on "packs" of third-party servers to process its mind.
- **Man-Machine Fusion**: The metallic structure with pulsing cyan circuits symbolizes the harmony between human design and raw computational power. It is technology serving life, not the other way around.

---

## ♻️ Origins and Evolution (OpenClaw - <https://openclaw.ai/>)

ZERO was not born in a vacuum. It is a "Hard Fork" and direct evolution of **OpenClaw** (formerly known as _Clawdbot_ and _Moltbot_).

- **Original Foundation (2025-2026)**: Created by **Peter Steinberger**, OpenClaw set the standard for local personal agents in TypeScript/Swift, reaching >100k stars on GitHub. We appreciate Steinberger's original vision of creating an AI that "runs on your device".
  - _Original Repository_: [github.com/openclaw/openclaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)
- **Continuous Learning (Issues & Bugs)**:
  - We actively monitor _Issues_ from the upstream repository. What fails there, we fix here.
  - **Real-world Examples of ZERO Fixes**:
    1. **Security (CVE-2026-25253)**: OpenClaw suffered from unauthenticated WebSockets and malicious "Skills" in the marketplace. **Zero Sentinel** implements a strict sandbox and does not load unsigned remote code.
    2. **"Token Burning" (Infinite Cost)**: OpenClaw sent the entire history on every "heartbeat". **ZERO** uses a _Context Compaction_ algorithm (Rust) that summarizes old memories, keeping token costs under control.
    3. **Gateway Memory Leaks**: Long sessions in OpenClaw used to crash Node.js. We moved critical state management and VAD to the **Rust Core**, eliminating memory leaks (GC pressure).
- **ZERO Technological Divergence**:
  - While OpenClaw focuses on TypeScript/Swift purity, **ZERO** adopted a hybrid **Rust + Node.js** architecture for critical performance.
  - We introduced **Zero Sentinel** to mitigate security risks that the original version did not cover (PII Firewall and Injection).
  - We rebuilt the UI (Altair) focused on a "Premium Sci-Fi" aesthetic versus the original utility UI.

> _We honor the code that came before (Peter Steinberger & Community), while building the future we need and aspire to right now._

## 🛑 Who It Is For (and Who It Is Not)

**"Magic must be 'invisible'."**

If you are an average user, you don't need to worry about the heavy engineering (Rust, WebSockets, Vectors). ZERO was also designed to abstract this brutal complexity into a fluid interface that _just works_.

- **For the User**: You get an untiring, private, and sovereign Personal Assistant. Install it, use it, govern your digital life. The rest is an implementation detail.
- **For the Engineer**: You get a cutting-edge, modular, and auditable agentic architecture playground to have some "fun".

> _We cannot abstract complexity, but we can make it invisible._

---

## ⚡️ What ZERO Does for You?

ZERO sets you free:

1. **Communication Sovereignty**:
   - **Unifies** WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, and Slack into a single stream of consciousness.
   - _Example_: _"Summarize all work messages from the last 2 hours and tell me only what requires immediate action."_
2. **Infinite Personal Memory (Local RAG)**:
   - Indexes your local files (PDFs, Docs, Code) without sending them to the cloud.
   - _Example_: _"Find that contract I signed in 2023 about 'service provision' and tell me the termination clause."_
3. **Real Task Execution (Agentic)**:
   - It doesn't just "talk", it **does**. Schedules meetings, sends emails, controls the terminal.
   - _Example_: _"Check my calendar, cancel the 3 PM meeting, and notify the team on Slack that I'm focused on the deploy."_
4. **Autonomous Coding**:
   - Acts as a Senior Software Engineer who knows your entire local codebase.
   - _Example_: _"Analyze the error logs for project X and propose a fix for the memory leak."_

## 🏛️ Philosophy and Engineering Principles

The ZERO ecosystem is built on four fundamental pillars, validated by rigorous software architecture standards:

1. **Local-First Sovereignty (The Ethical Personal "Google")**:
   - _Exponential Scale Potential_: Google scales by building massive Datacenters; **ZERO** intends to scale by utilizing the idle hardware of billions of personal devices.
   - _Vision_: Google organized the public web; ZERO organizes your private life (Files, Chats, Appointments, Finances) using `sqlite-vec` locally.
   - _Ethical Life Index_: We index your digital existence for _you_, and only for you. Unlike the cloud, where "scaling" means "more surveillance", here scaling intelligence doesn't cost your privacy.
2. **Hybrid Performance Architecture**: A critical performance core written in **Rust** (managing VAD, density telemetry, and encryption) seamlessly integrates with the flexibility of **TypeScript** for channel orchestration.
3. **Elite Security (OWASP LLM Top 10)**: ZERO is governed by **Zero Sentinel**, a proactive AI firewall that mitigates Prompt Injection, PII leakage, and hallucinations via forced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) validation and secret auditing via a native Rust engine.
4. **ClearCode Architecture**: Technical rigor with enforced complexity limits (maximum 500 lines per file). We ensure the system is modular and auditable; recently, we refactored critical modules like `MemoryIndexManager` and `MessageActionRunner` to meet this rigor.
5. **Proactive Agentic Autonomy**: Through the **Sentinel Engine** and **Speculative Pre-warming**, the system transcends reactivity. ZERO now detects execution failures (`Self-Healing`) and anticipates the required context before your next command, operating in high-fidelity deliberation loops.

## 🛸 Altair Interface: The Command Console

The **Altair Interface** is the official name of the browser-based (web-based) management console of the ZERO ecosystem.

While the **Gateway** operates behind the scenes (as the system's engine/brain), **Altair** is the visual "command cabin" you use to interact with it.

**Why "Altair Interface"?**
Altair is the brightest star in the Aquila (Eagle) constellation. Historically, it is one of the stars used by navigators to find their way. In the ZERO ecosystem, the Altair Interface fulfills this role: it is the point of light and reference that allowed the user to "navigate" safely and clearly.

### 1. Orchestration Center (Hub)

Altair allows you to visualize and control all system modules in one place without having to use only the command line (CLI). In it, you manage:

- **Contexts (Sessions)**: Where conversations and memories are visualized and persisted.
- **Connections (Channels)**: Integrations with Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, etc.
- **Capabilities (Skills)**: Extensions and plugins that give new "powers" to your agent.
- **Hardware & Presence**: Real-time telemetry of connected devices and active instances.

### 2. "Premium" and Futuristic Aesthetic

The Altair design is inspired by advanced telemetry systems (Sci-Fi UI), using a "mission panel" or "command bridge" aesthetic.

**But don't be alarmed:**
Despite the sophisticated appearance, usability is **familiar and intuitive**, similar to your favorite messenger (WhatsApp/Telegram). Visual complexity is optional and modular; you only see what you need to see.

### 3. Telemetry Bridge (Realtime)

It works by consuming the Gateway API via **WebSockets**. This means that the information you see (such as memory usage, inference engine status, and event logs) is updated in real-time, allowing instant diagnosis of system health.

### 4. Lab and Debug

Inside Altair is the **Playground (Lab)**, where you can:

- Test AI responses in a controlled environment.
- Verify the agent's reasoning (CoT - Chain of Thought).
- Audit the security of interactions and test tools.

> _If ZERO is the intelligence operating system, Altair is the monitor and control panel that makes this intelligence tangible and operable._

## 🧠 Give a Soul to Your Agent (SOUL.md)

ZERO is not just a tool; it is an entity. You can shape its personality, name, and moral guidelines by creating a file called `SOUL.md` at the root of your workspace.

- **Define the Persona**: _"You are Jarvis, a sarcastic butler."_ or _"You are TARS, focused on technical precision."_
- **Adjust the Tone**: Control verbosity, humor, and response style.
- **Primary Mission**: Give a unique purpose to your agent (e.g., "Protect my privacy at all costs").

> _ZERO reads your soul at every reboot and incorporates it into the deepest level of the system (`System Prompt`)._

## 🛡️ Security Protocol and Sentinel

The **Zero Sentinel** module implements active defenses against vector threats:

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/sentinel-artwork.png" alt="Zero Sentinel Artwork" width="500">
</p>

- **LLM Security Guardrails (OWASP Top 10)**: Active mitigation of Prompt Injection, Indirect Injection, and Jailbreaks.
- **Sentinel Diagnostic (Self-Healing)**: Diagnostic mechanism that intercepts terminal errors (exit codes, permissions, dependencies) and generates automatic AI-driven remedies.
- **IA Speculative Pre-warming**: Proactive heuristic scanning that injects relevant file context into the prompt before execution, reducing cognitive latency.
- **CoT Protocol with Self-Correction**: The model is forced to deliberate in `<think>` blocks, ensuring logic before action.
- **PII & Secrets Firewall**: Real-time scanning (Rust engine) for ID numbers, Tax IDs, Emails, and API keys.
- **Scale Performance**: Data sanitization via vectorized regex in Rust/Native, ensuring high-density throughput without interface lag.
- **Sandbox Isolate**: Tool execution and navigation in isolated environments (Docker/Firecracker) with file path sanitization.
- **Stealth Mode & Lockdown**: Instant hiding of sensitive data and emergency freeze via `zero panic`.
- **Local Sovereignty**: Priority local processing, ensuring compliance with LGPD and GDPR by design.

### 🔬 Privacy Engineering (Deep Dive)

_Answering the provocation: "Are detection algorithms really effective?"_

**Zero Sentinel** is not just a keyword filter. It operates at the agentic kernel level in **Rust** to ensure sub-millisecond latency:

1. **High Entropy Detection (Shannon Entropy)**:
   - Traditional algorithms fail to detect new or unusual API keys. Sentinel calculates string entropy in sliding windows. If a block of text looks "mathematically random" (like a private key `sk-abc123...`), it is incinerated before touching the log or prompt.
2. **Native Regex (Rust `regex` crate)**:
   - AOT (Ahead-Of-Time) compilation of complex patterns for sensitive numbers (CPF, CNPJ, Credit Cards). The cost of sanitizing 1MB of text is negligible, allowing _everything_ to be audited in real-time without conversation "lag".
3. **Autonomy vs. Collective Intelligence Trade-off**:
   - ZERO rejects the premise that intelligence requires centralized telemetry.
   - **Mental Model**: We use "frozen collective knowledge" (the pre-trained LLM) and specialize it with "living sovereign context" (your local RAG). You don't need to send your data to train others' AI; the AI comes trained to serve _your_ data.

> _Security is not a feature. It is the default state._

## 🤝 Contribution and Vibes

We are building the infrastructure of tomorrow. Contributions are welcome from engineers seeking technological sovereignty.

- **Docstring Standards**: We follow the strict JSDoc standard for technical documentation.
- **Modern Stack**: TS (Node 22), Rust (napi-rs), Vitest, Playwright.

This repository is an evolution of Clawdbot, adapted and re-architected as **ZERO** by **Leandro Azevedo** for Brazilian sovereignty, including advanced security and native local hardware support.

### 🛠️ Common Troubleshooting

- **`command not found` error after installation**:
  Restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` (or `.zshrc`). If it persists, use the full path: `pnpm zero`.

- **External Access (VPS/LAN)**:
  For security, ZERO listens only on `localhost`. To access externally:
  1. Use an SSH tunnel (Recommended): `ssh -L 18789:localhost:18789 user@vps_ip`
  2. Check the `~/.zero/zero.json` config. `"bind": "lan"` mode allows external connections via `0.0.0.0` (Use with caution in public environments!).
