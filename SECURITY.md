# ∅ ZERO Security Policy

## Security by Design

ZERO is built on the philosophy of **Security by Design** and **Zero Trust Architecture**. We believe security is not a feature but a foundational requirement for any Personal Agent Operating System (A-POS).

### Core Pillars

1. **Local-first Sovereignty**: Your data never leaves your machine unless explicitly configured.
2. **Least Privilege**: Agents and tools operate with the minimum required access scope.
3. **Auditability**: All agentic actions are logged in the immutable Audit Crypt.
4. **Active Defense**: Zero Sentinel provides real-time protection against prompt injection and sensitive data disclosure.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in ZERO, please report it privately.

- **Email**: `security@zero.local` (or open a private security advisory on GitHub)
- **What to include**: Reproduction steps, impact assessment, and a minimal PoC if possible.

## Security Audit

Always run `zero security audit --deep` to verify your local configuration. Use the `--fix` flag to automatically apply hardening recommendations.
